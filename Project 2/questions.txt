------------------------------ Little notes -----------------------------------------
The field "flag" in the entity Country stores the path of where the flag is stored. In our INSERT statements it contains a web link.
The iso_code was chosen to be a VARCHAR(3) because of definition on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes.
The cni was chosen to be a VARCHAR(15) because of it is a reasonable size value and data type for a national identifier of boats.
The year of boats are constrained between the current year and the year of 1800, once the oldest active boat is from a prior year (https://sdmaritime.org/latest-news/celebrating-star-of-indias-155-years/#:~:text=Star%20of%20India%2C%20built%20in,the%20globe%20twenty%2Done%20times).
The id_card was chosen to be a NUMERIC value, beacuse with this datatype it is possible to constrain its size to a fixed value, in this case 15.
The mmsi was chosen to be an UNIQUE and NUMERIC value because it is the world wide convention (https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/h_sf06198.html).   
The latitude and longitude are constrained according to the international convention (https://www.latlong.net/).
